<h2>Latin equivalents</h2>
<html><body><p></p><p>Imagine you have a text-processing program that doesn't work with the ASCII characters. Still, you need to use it and don't have time to correct that issue. You've decided to write another program that will replace all the letters with ligatures and diacritic marks with their equivalents from the Latin alphabet. The list of replacements is the following:</p>
<p>é -&gt; e<br/>
ë -&gt; e<br/>
á -&gt; a<br/>
å -&gt; aa<br/>
œ -&gt; oe<br/>
æ -&gt; ae</p>
<p>Complete the code below so that the function <code class="java">normalize</code> (<code class="java">def</code> is a keyword used to declare functions) would take a string with diacritics and return the one where all of them have been replaced with the equivalents.</p></body></html><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Charlotte Brontë</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Charlotte Bronte</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
