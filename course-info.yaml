summary: "<p>The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition\
  \ for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. Since\
  \ you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend\
  \ to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. Unfortunately, you weren&#39;t\
  \ clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart\
  \ of Honest Calculator. You will have to put some effort into assembling it.</p>\r\
  \n\r\n<p>Working on the project, you&#39;re at first required to build a simple\
  \ calculator which later on is going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves\
  \ by becoming more and more honest with them. For example, if they need to do calculations\
  \ with multidigit numbers, that, okay, might be tricky, so the calculator won&#39;t\
  \ be very hard on them and just solve it. However, if the equation is a simple sum\
  \ of two integers like&nbsp;<em>2 + 3</em>, maybe it should suggest solving it themselves.\
  \ Even worse, if it&#39;s multiplication by one or zero, that is just of the line!&nbsp;After\
  \ all, it&#39;s a competition organized by the International Union Against&nbsp;<em>Idleness</em>.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
