<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>We will start by implementing the flowchart below. Copy the messages carefully and assign them to the program variables. It makes no difference whether you make a list or each message is a separate variable. The appropriate messages must be displayed according to the flowchart. </p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Implement the flowchart above. Please, follow our recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code class="java">calc</code> should have the following format: <code class="java">x operation y</code>. For example: <code class="java">2 + 3</code>, <code class="java">2 + g</code> or <code class="java">3.1 r 5</code>;</li>
<li>The variables <code class="java">x</code> and <code class="java">y</code> must be of the <code class="java">float</code> or <code class="java">int</code> type. The <code class="java">oper</code> variable is a one-character string. Check whether the passed values have proper types. The delimiter must be a dot;</li>
<li>Copy the messages below carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Please, do not add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_0 = "Enter an equation"

msg_1 = "Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!"

msg_2 = "Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?"</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 + m
Do you even know what numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
&gt; 3 n 3
Yes ... an interesting math operation. You've slept through all classes, haven't you?
Enter an equation
&gt; m - 2
Do you even know what the numbers are? Stay focused!
Enter an equation
&gt; 4.7 * 5.2</code></pre>
