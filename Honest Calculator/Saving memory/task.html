<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>To complete the project, you need to implement the flowchart below. The old blocks are red-colored. Be careful; some flows can work differently. The functions from the previous stage have not been changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="2097" name="Stage5.jpg" src="https://ucarecdn.com/5a9953cf-380a-4a12-a88b-bb45edd5e890/" width="1046"/></p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Implement the flowchart. Please, follow the recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in functions to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>Copy the messages below. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_10 = "Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)"

msg_11 = "Don't be silly! It's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)"

msg_12 = "Last chance! Do you really want to embarrass yourself? (y / n)"</code></pre>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
