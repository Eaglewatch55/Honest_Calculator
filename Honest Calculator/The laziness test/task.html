<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Implement the flowchart below. Take a good look â€” there're two functions. The old blocks are in red. Be careful; some flows can now work differently.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Implement the flowchart with two functions. Please, mind the recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in functions to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>Notice that the function <code class="java">is_one_digit()</code> is supposed to check whether it has an integer value in the <em><strong>mathematical sense</strong></em>, e.g. 3.0 is an integer, 3.1 is a non-integer number. Thus, do <strong>NOT</strong> check the type of variable, but the number itself. You can use a special built-in method <code class="java">.is_integer()</code> on a float variable to check if a number is an integer.</li>
<li>Copy the messages carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="java">msg_6 = " ... lazy"

msg_7 = " ... very lazy"

msg_8 = " ... very, very lazy"

msg_9 = "You are"</code></pre>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 2 / M
You are ... lazy
Yeah... division by zero. Smart move...
Enter an equation
&gt; 1 * M
You are ... lazy ... very lazy ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; y
Enter an equation
&gt; 899 * 0
You are ... very, very lazy
0.0
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt; n
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt; n</code></pre>
