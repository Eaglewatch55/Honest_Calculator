<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Take a look at the upgraded flowchart. As before, the old blocks are red-colored. Be careful; some flows can now work differently.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>To complete this stage, you need to implement the flowchart above. While doing it, please, follow our recommendations below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use the built-in functions to calculate from a string;</li>
<li>The <code class="java">memory</code> variable must be of a float type; use this variable to store intermediate result;</li>
<li>There are no tests when <code class="java">M</code> is negative. For example, there will be no test input like this: <code class="java">-M + 6</code>;</li>
<li>Copy two messages. The tests will check if the correct message appears in the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">msg_4 = "Do you want to store the result? (y / n):" 

msg_5 = "Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):"</code></pre>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter an equation
&gt; 3 + 3
6
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt;y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt;y
Enter an equation
&gt; 5 + M
11
Do you want to store the result? (y / n):
&gt;y
Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):
&gt;n</code></pre>
